# KSB Custom Cards
Welcome to my custom card repository. It contains its own archetypes and commissions from players with very original ideas. The balance is taken into account for healthy use and compatible with the current playing style. Enjoy it.
Visit my website to look at the archetypes. -> https://ksb-custom.github.io/KSB-Archetypes/

If you can't see custom cards in Edopro you have to check 'Alternate formats', this show all cards including anime and custom cards.
